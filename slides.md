# What is Easy-MASM?

Easy-MASM is the simplest way to assemble, link, and run masm32 files for COMP-2660.

It works on Windows out of the box, Linux with WINE installed, and *hopefully* MacOS thanks to Docker.

You can also run it on popular online IDEs like GitHub Codespaces and Gitpod

# Why use Easy-MASM?

1. Easy-MASM is quick to set up, it only takes three easy steps to get started.
2. It is lightweight and small to download at less than 8mb! (As opposed to Visual Studio which is several GB in size)
3. It is cross-platform. Whether you're on Windows or Linux, you can use Easy-MASM (Mac users can use Easy-MASM too via Docker, GitHub Codespaces, SSH into the CS Servers, No Machine, etc.)
4. You can use any text editor you want. Whether it's VS Code, Notepad++, or Vim, Easy-MASM does not discriminate

# Three Easy Steps to Get Started

1. Clone or download the Easy-MASM GitHub repo found at: https://github.com/jere-mie/easy-masm
2. Edit the “source.asm” file (or create your own .asm file) in the “src” folder
3. Run your program from the Command Prompt or PowerShell using `.\run source`
